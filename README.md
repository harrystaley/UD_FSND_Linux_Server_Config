# UD_FSND_Linux_Server_Config

## Project Overview
This repository is part of the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree program and focuses on configuring a Linux server to host web applications securely and efficiently. The project covers various aspects of server configuration including user management, security settings, and essential server setups. This is crucial for creating a robust deployment environment that ensures the security and performance of web applications.

### Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- **docs/**: Documentation files and setup guidelines.
- **scripts/**: Shell scripts for automating setup and configuration tasks.
- **config_files/**: Sample configuration files for server setup.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview and instructions.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- A Linux server (e.g., an Ubuntu Server).
- Root access to the server.
- Basic knowledge of Linux commands and server management.

### Installation Steps
1. **Update Your Server**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```
2. **Install Necessary Packages**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi git
   ```
3. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/UD_FSND_Linux_Server_Config.git
   cd UD_FSND_Linux_Server_Config
   ```
4. **Run Setup Scripts**:
   Navigate to the `scripts/` directory and execute the setup scripts:
   ```bash
   cd scripts/
   sudo chmod +x *.sh
   ./initial_server_setup.sh
   ```

### Configuration
Follow the configuration files and guidelines in the `config_files/` directory to set up various server features and security settings.

## Usage
After setting up and configuring the server, you can deploy your web applications. Here's a basic example of deploying a Flask application:
1. **Create a Flask App**:
   In your home directory, create a new Flask app:
   ```bash
   mkdir myapp
   cd myapp
   ```
   Create a simple `app.py`:
   ```python
   from flask import Flask
   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route("/")
   def hello():
       return "Hello, World!"

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       app.run()
   ```
2. **Configure Apache to Serve the Flask App**:
   Refer to the sample Apache configuration in `config_files/flask_app.conf`. Adjust it to point to your application and place it in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/`.

3. **Enable the Site and Restart Apache**:
   ```bash
   sudo a2ensite flask_app
   sudo systemctl restart apache2
   ```
